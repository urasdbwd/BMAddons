Compiling may improve resource usage!
## Usage
1. Modify your `webpage_port` to whatever you have in your bma_config `socketIOPort`
2. Make sure the password on your `bma_config.json` is **NOT** the default.
3. Change the password to whatever you'd like and remember the password must reflect correctly on the controller's config as well for it to work. Failure to do this **WILL** cause errors.
4. Be sure to `ufw allow <port>`
5. `chmox +x runner.bin`
6. `./runner.bin`
## Configuration
If you run all accounts on VPS, run the controller on your (or one of your) VPS as well.\
If you run all accounts locally, run the controller locally.\
If you run some accounts locally and some accounts on VPS, run controller locally.
